Limitations Benefits and risk

TRAVEL AND TOURISM.
One benefit if this face image recogniton is that the software can be used
on a phone. This makes it much more portable and easy to use when travelling.
As well as that this software can be used at airports to identify threats and
prevent danger. Despite there are limititions such as the fact that it may be 
hard to identify a person in areas of high tourism because there are to many
people. As well as that the software may need to be updated as it may not 
recognise things abroad. This is risky because certain things cannot be 
recognised and people may get mislead.

GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT.
One benefit of the face image recognition in this scenario
is that it can be used make games. Not only does this provide people
with entertainment but it can help people secure a source of income
and set up a business. On the other hand, games with lots of images
need to be continiously updated. This may limit what people can do. This
may leave people unsatisfied leading to a risk of business failure.

EDUCATION AND LEARNING.
One benefit is that this software can be used to educate children.
The software displays an image and the name of what the image is.
This is an easy and efficient way to learn. However there are limitations to this
such as the fact that it only displays the name of the image. This may prove
innefective as some children cannot read and may not be able to pronounce the 
names of what the image displays. This may pose a threat to the reliability 
of the software. In order to avoid this I think the softwarw should be updated with 
a voice system that reads what the object is.

TRANSPORT AND NAVIGATION
The image recognition would be very beneficial in transport and navigation as on maps it
would be very easy to identify different places. This can be used to help guide planes and
even self driven cars. However this comes with limitations one being that in the dark it may 
not be able to identify certain images. This can cause misdirection and potentially lead to peope
being lost or even dead.

MEDICINE AND HEALTHCARE
One benefit of the image recognition in healthcare is that it can be used to identify cells.
This can help doctors in operations aswell as providing scientists with the oppurtunity with 
to develop new medicine. Despite this there are limitations such as the fact that the software
is not yet small enough to be fit into an actual person.Furthermore, some diseases hide inside cells.
The recognition can provide false information which may mislead doctors and scientists. This would 
risk patients health.
